TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE LORD MARQUIS OF NEWCASTLE.  

My Lord,  
It may be said to me, as one said to a Lady, Work Lady Work, let writing
Books alone. For surely Wiser Women ne'r writ one; But your Lordship never bid me to Work. nor leave Writing, except when you would perswade me to spare so much time from my Study as to take to the Air for my Health; the truth is, My Lord, I cannot Work, I mean such Works as Ladies use to pass their Time withall, and if I could, the Materials of such Works would cost more than the Work would be worth, besides all the Time and Pains bestow'd upon it. You may ask me, what Works I mean; I answer, Needle-works, Spinning-works, Preserving-works, as also Bakin'g, and Cooking-works, as making Cakes, Pyes, Puddings, and the like, all
which I am Ignorant of and as I am Ignorant in these Imployments, so I am Ignorant in Gaming, Dancing, and Revelling; But yet, I must ask you leave to say, that I am not a Dunce in all Imployments, for I Understand the Keeping of Sheep, and Ordering of a grange, indifferently well, although I do not Busie my self much with it, by reason my Scribling takes away the most part of my Time. Perchance some may say, that if my Understanding be most of Sheep and a Grange, it is a Beastly Understanding; My answer is, I wish Men were as Harmless as most Beasts are, then surely the World would be more Quiet and Happy than it is, for then there would not be such Pride, Vanity, Ambition, Covetousness, Faction, Treachery, and Treason, as is now; Indeed one might very well say in his Prayers to God, O Lord God, I do beseech thee of thy infinite Mercy, to make Man so, and order his Mind, Thoughts, Passions, and Appetites, lik'e Beasts, that they may be Temperate, Sociable, Laborious. Patient, Prudent, Provident, Brotherly-loving and Neighbourly-kind, all which Beasts are, but most Men not. But leaving most Men to Beasts, I return to your Lordship, who is one of the Best of men, whom God hath fill'd with Heroick Fortitude, Noble Gnerosity, Poetical Wit, Moral Honesty, Natural Love, Neighbourly-kindness, Great Patience, Loyal Duty, and Celestial Piety, and I pray God as Zealously and Earnestly to Bless you with perfect Health and Long Life, as becomes

TO ALL PROFESSORS OF LEARNING AND ART. MOST FAMOUSLY-LEARNED,

_I Wish I could Write so Wisely, Wittily, Eloquently and Methodically, as might be
Worthy of your Perusal; but if any of your Noble Profession should Humble themselvesso Low as to Read my Works, or part of them, I pray Consider my Sex and Bredding,and they will fully Excuse those Faults which must Unavoidably be found
in my Works. But although I have no Learning, yet give me leave to Admire it, and to wish I were one of your Society, for certainly, were I Empress fo the World, I would Advance those that have most Learning and Witt, by which I believe the Earth would rather be an Heaven, since both Men and government would be as Celestial, for I am Confident that Wisdom, and for the most part Virtue is Inherent in those that are Masters of Learning, and Indued with Wit; And to this sort of Persons I do Offer my Works, although to be Condemned on the Altar fo their Censure, and rest Satisfied with the Honour that they thought them Worthy to be judged. Thus, whether my Works Live or Dye, I am Devoted to be_ 

Your Servant M.N.  

THE PREFACE.  

_Noble Readers_,  

I Hope you Will not make the Mistake of a Word a Crime in my Wit, as some former
Readers have done, for in my Poems they found Fault that the Number was not just, nor every Line Matched with a Perfect Rime; But I can answer for that Book, that there bebut some such Errors in it, and those as were by Chance; besides, in some Languages as Latin and Greek, which are accounted the Chief, they regard not Rimes in their Poems, but only an Exact number of Feet and Measures; however Rimes and Numbers are only as the Garments, and not as the Body of Wit; but I have been more Exact in my other Book call’d _Natural Descriptions_, wherein most Verses are just both for Number and Rimes. As for my Work, _The World’s Olio_, they may say some Words are not Exactly Placed, which I confess to be very likely, and not only in that, but in all the rest of my Works there may be such Errors, for I was not Bred in an University, or a Free—School to Learn the Art of Words; neither do I take it for a Disparagemente of my Works, to have the Forms, Terms, Words, Numbers, or Rhymes found Fault with, so they do not find Fault with the Variety ofthe Subjects, or the Sense and Reason, Wit, and Fancy, for I leave the Formal, or Wordative part to Fools, and the Material or Sensitive part to Wise men. Concerning my _Philosophical Opinions_, some did say I was too Obscure, and not
Plain Enough for their Understanding; I must confess, I writ that Book at first at the same time when I wrote my _Poems_, but to my Reason it was Plain as I could write it, and if some Readers could not Understand it, I am not Nature to give them Witt or Understanding; yet have I since not only Over-viewed, and Reformed that Book, but made a great Addition to it, so that I believe I have now so clearly Declared my Sense and Meaning therein, that those which Understand it not must not only be Irrational, but Insensible Creatures. As for my Book of _Playes_, some find Fault they are not made up Exactly, nor the Scenes placed Justly, as also I have not in some Playes caused all the Actors to be of an Acquaintance, but this same Fault they find, I have Express’d in one of the Epistles before that Book, which they fling back upon my Work. As for my _Orations_, I have heard, that some do Ceusure me for speaking too Freely, and Patronizing Vice too much, but I would have them not be too Rash in Judging, but to Consider, first, whether there he a sufficient Reason that may move them to give such a Censure. for truly I am as much an Enemy to Vice as I am a Friend to Virtue &amp; do Persecute Vice with as perfect an Hatred, as I do Pursue Virtue with an Intire, and Pure Love, which is Sufficiently Known to those that Know me; and therefore, it is not out of Love to Vice that I plead for it, but only to Exercise my Fancy, for surely the Wisest, and Eloquentest Orators, have not been Ashamed to Defend Vices upon such Accounts, and why may not I do the like? for my Orations for the most part are Declamations, wherein I speak _Pro_ and _Con_, and Determine nothing; and as for that Part which contains several Pleadings, it is Fit and Lawful that both Parties. should bring in their Arguments as well as they can, to make their Cases Good; but I matter not their Censure, for it would be an Endless Trouble to me, to Answer every ones Foolish Exception; an Horse of a Noble Spirit slights the Brawling of a Petty Cur, and so do I. As for the Present Book of Letters, I know not as yet what Aspersions they will lay upon it, but I fear the’l say, they are not written in a Mode-style, that is in a Complementing and Romantical way, with High Words, and Mystical Expressions, as most of our Modern Letter-writers use to do; But, Noble Readers, I do not intend to Present you here with Long Complements in Short Letters; but with Short Descriptions in Long Letters; the truth is', they are rather Scenes than Letters, for I have Endeavoured under the Cover of Letters to Express the Humors of Mankind, and the Actions of a Man’s Life by the Correspondence of two Ladies, living at some Short Distance from each other, which make it not only their Chief Delight and Pastime, but their Tye in Friendship, to Discourse by Letters, as they would do if' they were Personally together, so that these Letters are an Imitation of a Personal Visitation and Conversation, which I think is Better (I am sure more Profitable) than those Conversations that are an Imitation of Romantical Letters, which are but Empty Words, and Vain Complements. But the Reason why I have set them forth in the Form of Letters, and not of Playes, is first that I have put forth Twenty Plays already, which number I thought to be Sufficient, next, I saw that Variety of Forms did Please the Readers best, and that lastly they would be more taken with the Brevity of Letters, than the Formality of Scenes, and whole Playes, whose Parts and Plots cannot be Understood till the whole Play be Read over, whereas a Short Letter will give a Full Satisfaction of what they Read. And thus I thought this to be the Best Way or Form to put this Work into, which if you Approve of, I have my Reward.  

UPON HER EXCELLENCY THE AUTHORESS.  

_This Lady only to her self she Writes   
And all her Letters to her sefl lndites;   
For in her sefl so many Creatures be,  
Like many Commonwealths, yet all Agree.  
Man’s Head’s a World, where Thoughts are Born and Bred,   
And Reason's Emperour in every Head;  
But in all Heads doth not a Caesar Reig'n,  
A Wise Augustus hath not every Brain,  
And Reason in some Brains from Rule ’s put out  
By Mad, Rebellious Thoughts, and Factions Rout;   
And Great Disorder in such Brains will be,  
Not any Thought with Reason will Agree;   
But in her Brain doth Reason Govern well,   
Not any Thought 'gainst Reason doth Rebell,   
But doth Obey what Reason doth Command,  
When ’tis his Will, doth Travel Sea and Land,   
As some do Travel out to Kingdornes far,  
And Guided are by Observation's Star,  
They bring Intellgiencefrom every State,  
Their Peace, their Wars, their Factions, and their Hate,   
And into every City Travel free,  
Relate their Customs, Traflicks, Policy,   
Observe each Magistrate, their Formal Face,  
And what Authority they bear, or Place,   
Whether they Covetously do Extort,  
Or are Ambitious, giving Bribes at Court,   
To Raise to Places, or to Hide their Crime,  
For thus Men do to Wealth and Ofiice Clime,   
And some into the Churches go to see  
Who Kneels in Pray’r, or comes for Company,   
Implores her Favour, and makes his Complaint   
Be Known, Or who doth turn her eyes about,  
To shew her Face, or see, a Lover out;  
And some to Balls, and Masks, and Playes do go,   
And some within Kings Courts do get a Place,   
Observe the Grandeur, and the Courtly Grace,  
The Ceremony and Splendor of a court,  
Their Playes, Balls, Masks, and every several Sport,   
And all their Amorous Courtships which they make  
And how the Ladies do each Courtship take,  
The Antick Postures fo the Younger Race,  
Their Mimick Gestures, and Aflected Pace,  
Their Amorous Smiles, and Glancing Wanton Eyes,   
All which do Noble Souls Hate and Despise;  
And some amongst the Privy-Counsel get,   
Where round a Table Prince and Nobles sit,  
Hear what they say, Observe their Cross Debates,  
And mark which speakes through Faction, which through Hates  
Some Lord that is in Favour more than he,  
For in State Matters seldom they Agree.  
And thus Her thoughts, the Creatures of her Mind,   
Do Travel through the World amongst Mankind,   
And then Return, and to the Mind do bring  
All the Relations fo each several thing;  
And Observation Guides them back again  
To Reason, their Great King, that’s in the Brain;  
Then Contemplation calls the Senses stragiht,   
Which Ready are, and Diligently Wait   
Commanding Two these Lettersfor to Write,   
Touch in the Hand, as also the Eye-sight,  
These Two the Soul’s Clerks are which do Inscribe,   
And Write all Truly down, having no Bribe._  

TO THE CENSORIOUS READER.   

_Reader, you'L think, perchance, my Wit in Fault,   
Like Meat that’s too much Brin’d, and Over-salt,   
But better Poets far than I have been,  
Have written Sharper, and with Greater Splene,  
Yet they have much been Prais’d for writing so,   
And on Advancing Stigues OF Fame do go;  
But my Poor Writings they no Malace know,   
Nor on a Crabbed Nature did they Crow;  
I to Particulars give no Abuse,  
My Wit Indites for Prfiotable Use,  
That Men may see their Follies, and their Crimes,   
Their Errours, Vanities, and Idle Times,  
Not that I think they do not Know them well,   
But lest they should Forget, Im’ Bold to tell,  
For to Remember them, like those that Ride,   
Not thinking on their Way, may chance to Slide,  
Or Fall into a Ditch, so I for Fear  
Bid them take Heed, Beware, and have a Care,   
For there are Stumps fo Trees, or a Deep Pit,   
Or Dangerous Passages where Thieves do sit   
And Wait, or Ravenous Beasts do lye for Prey,   
Of such a Lane where’s Foul and Dirty Way   
And so fo Waters, and each Dangerous place:   
But I write not to any mans Disgrace;  
Then Censure not my Satyr witfor Crime  
Nor putting this Epistle into Rime._
